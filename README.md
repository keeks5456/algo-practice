# Description
This repository is for algorithms either from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRack](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). There will be folders for Big O notation explaining Time & Space Complexity. I have structured this repository is to record my personal growth in learning how to solve & understand algorithms, and the Big O time / space complexity.
