    <h2> Array Data Structures</h2>

    <h5><b>One-Dimensional Array:</b></h5><p> an array that only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it</p>
    <p>Ex: let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];
        console.log(simpleArray.length);
        // logs 7</p>
    <h5><b> Multi-Dimensional Array:</b></h5><p>an array that contains other arrays. Notice that this array also contains JavaScript objects, which we will examine very closely in our next section, but for now, all you need to know is that arrays are also capable of storing complex objects.</p>
    <p>let complexArray = [
  [
    {
      one: 1,
      two: 2
    },
    {
      three: 3,
      four: 4
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      a: "a",
      b: "b"
    },
    {
      c: "c",
      d: "d"
    }
  ]
];</p>

        <h2>Accessing An Array</h2>
        <p> In an array, each array item has an index. This index doubles as the position of that item in the array, and how you reference it. However, it is important to note, that JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element of an array is actually at the zeroth position, not the first. In order to retrieve an element from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or more commonly, to a variable which references an array object. This is known as bracket notation. </p>

        <b><p>let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
            <br/><br/>
            let ourVariable = ourArray[0];
            // ourVariable equals "a"</p></b>

        <h2>Copy an Array with the Spread Operator</h2>
        <p> ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax.</p>
         <b><p>let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];<br/>
           let thatArray = [...thisArray];
            // thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]
            // thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray</p></b>
