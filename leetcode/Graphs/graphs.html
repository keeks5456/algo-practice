        <h2>What are Graphs</h2>
        <p>A graph is data structure of finite (possible mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes and points), together with a set of ordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.</p>
        <P>These pairs known as edges (also called links & lines), and for a directed graph is also known as arrows.</P>
