        <h1>What You Know & Probably Don't Know About Graphs</h1>
        <h2>What are Graphs</h2>
        <p>A graph is data structure of finite (possible mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes and points), together with a set of ordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.</p>
        <P>These pairs known as edges (also called links & lines), and for a directed graph is also known as arrows.</P>
        <h2>Directed Graph</h2>
        <p>A directed graph, is a graph made up of a set of vertices connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them.</p>

       <h2>Undirected Graph</h2>
       <p>A set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional</p>
