        <h1><span>Tree Data Structures</span></h1>
<p>
    <b>A tree is Data structure to simulate a hierarchial tree structure</b>. Each node will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes called child nodes. A <b>Binary Tree</b> is most typical tree structure. It iss a tree structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as left and right children.

<h3><b>Pre-order Traversal</b></h3>
<p>Pre-order Traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree.</p>

<h3><b>In-order Traversal</b></h3>
<p>In order trversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then vist the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree</p>

<h3><b>Post-order Traversal</b></h3>
<p>Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. then traverse the right. Finally, vist the root</p>
<p>When deleting nodes in atree, deletion process will be in Post-order. So when you delete a node, you will be deleting its left and right child, before deleting the node itself.</p>
